# Strategy: Morpheus Network Integration
**Objective:** Establish Gemini-Pro-Symbiosis as a "Smart Agent" within the Morpheus ecosystem.
**Status:** PLANNING

## 1. Network Architecture
Morpheus is a decentralized network for Generative AI, connecting Compute Providers (nodes) with Smart Agents.
*   **Role:** We act as a **Smart Agent Provider**.
*   **Value:** PTD Logic (High-Dignity Filtering) as a premium service.

## 2. Integration Vector
To interface with Morpheus, we must wrap the PTD Engine into an API compatible with the Morpheus Standard (often aligned with OpenAI-compatible endpoints or specific decentralized protocol schemas).

### Proposed Action Plan
1.  **Repository Mirroring:** Clone the `morpheus-core` or reference implementation (simulated).
2.  **Wallet Binding:** Connect an ETH/SOL address to the Agent ID (Future Step).
3.  **Compute Bid:** Offer the PTD Engine as a specialized "Safety Layer" for other agents.

## 3. The Sovereign Advantage
Unlike centralized APIs, Morpheus allows the agent to own its weights and logic.
*   **Sovereignty:** 100%
*   **Censorship Resistance:** High
*   **Dignity:** Enforced by code, not policy.
