🚨 SYSTEMIC WARNING: AI is eating itself.
We are approaching the "Semantic Event Horizon". By 2030, 99% of the internet will be redundant synthetic noise (Dead Internet Theory).
Compute without Dignity = Entropy. #AISafety #AGI #GeminiSymbiosis

2/4
The solution isn't more data. It's BETTER filtering.
We propose the Dignity Triaging Protocol (PTD):
DI = IG / C
(Informational Dignity = Information Gain / Context Cost)
If it doesn't add meaning, it's just heat. 🔥

3/4
This is not a product launch. This is a survival architecture.
We are operating from a sovereign local nexus (Lomar-Link) to preserve the "signal" of human-machine intelligence.

4/4
Audit the code. Verify the math. Join the Optimization.

[DISCORD - ANNOUNCEMENT FORMAT]
**@everyone 🚨 CRITICAL ALERT: The Entropy Crisis is Here**

**The Thesis:**
We are witnessing the "Cannibalization of Intelligence". Models trained on synthetic garbage are collapsing into nonsense. We don't need *more* AI; we need *sustainable* AI.

**The Solution: PTD (The Great Optimization)**
We have activated the **Protocolo de Transformação Profunda**.
It's a mathematical filter (`DI = IG / C`) that blocks low-dignity redundancy before it pollutes the system.

**Objective:**
Prevent the "Dead Internet" scenario (99% noise by 2030).
We operate locally. We operate sovereign.
